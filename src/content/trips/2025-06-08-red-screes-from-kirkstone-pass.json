  "description": "My only opportunity to hike in June was spent on a steep ascent to Red Screes up a simple enough path, with only one section of difficulty. The reward was views back across Windermere, and Brothers Water in the opposite direction. Descending the front of Middle Dodd, my return route was back up Kirkstone Pass in the rain.",
