  "description": "My third time in Iceland in a year, this time to capture the Nootka lupine bloom as part of my year of flower photography. With much the same itinerary as my first trip, this was a trip of mastery with a few new places sprinkled in. Excellent weather on the days that mattered made this trip phenomenal!",
