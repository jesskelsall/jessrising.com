  "title": "Aurora at Clatteringshaws Loch",
  "description": "The strongest aurora since 2005, caused by 5+ coronal mass ejections, several earth-directed. My friend and I travelled to Galloway Forest Park in search of clear and dark skies with a northward loch view. We were blindsided by the aurora overhead and in the south, naked eye visible in green and pink. An unforgettable once-in-a-generation event.",
