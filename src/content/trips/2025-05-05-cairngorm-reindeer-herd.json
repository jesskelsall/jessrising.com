  "description": "My ninth visit, to see the reindeer calves born mere days ago. Starting with a peaceful walk through Abernethy Forest to Loch Mallachie, the spring heatwave brought blue skies and warm weather to the hill trip. The calves were mostly seen from distance through a telephoto lens. On return, a detour to Garry Bridge and the Loch Tummel viewpoint for pristine green views.",
