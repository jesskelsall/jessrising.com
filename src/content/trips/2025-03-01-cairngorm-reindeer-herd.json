  "description": "My eighth visit, in March when meeting the herd on the mountain means hiking rather than visiting the enclosure. After two years of sponsoring Fab the reindeer after our initial encounter, we are reunited including a hand feeding! The day is capped off with a trip on the Cairngorm Mountain furnicular above the snow line.",
