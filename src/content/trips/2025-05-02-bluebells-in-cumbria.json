  "description": "What started as a day out in the Lake District to catch the bluebells in bloom, principally in Rannerdale, ended up being a prolific day of photography. Catching F-15E Strike Eagles roaring over Crummock Water, wandering various forests, and even photographing fields of rapeseed made for an incredibly varied and enjoyable day out.",
