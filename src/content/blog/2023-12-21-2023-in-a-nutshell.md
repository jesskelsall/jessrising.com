# 2023 in a Nutshell

- Tags:

2023 has been an eventful year for me! In this blog post I'll summarise my hobbies and goals this year and share some key statistics.


## Adventuring

Adventuring is an umbrella term I use for hobbies that take me to adventurous destinations. regardless of why I'm there. I typically break this up further into: holidays, hiking, day trips, and travelling for work.

- Holidays
  - Defined as 2+ consecutive days away from home.
  - 16 total holidays - 13x Scotland, 2x Wales, 1x England.
  - 26 days of work leave used on holidays (only made possible through changing jobs).
  - 3 days of remote working while on holiday.
  - 10 different people I adventured with, not including solo adventuring.
-  Day trips
  - 5 visits to the [Cairngorm Reindeer Herd](https://www.cairngormreindeer.co.uk/), 4 as part of holidays.
  - 4 concerts.
  - 3 aurora sightings.
  - 3 steam train sightings.
-  Work
  - 5 days out from work for scheduled medical treatment.
  - 3 work events across 2 companies.

Photos related to each of my trips this year can be found on [my trips page](../../trips).

This year I set myself a goal to go on holiday every month in 2023, which I achieved. The most holidays I went on in a calendar month was 2.

I also set myself a goal to go outdoors each weekend, somewhere different, for at least 1 hour. Picking up hiking as a hobby and getting into photography typically made this trivial, though there were 2 technical successes along the way and 2 of my weekends in December lacked outdoor activities. In all 50/52 is a strong result and has had the desired effect: building a habit of casual adventuring over sitting indoors.

## Hiking

In February I set myself the goal of hiking all 214 [Wainwrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wainwrights) over 4 years, averaging at 54 per year. I set myself goals for this year as I started building fitness, scrambling skills, and habit:

- **Hike all of Wainwright's Book 7** (33 summits) **before a self-imposed summer break:** completed on 1st July with [Great Borne & Starling Dodd](../../gallery?trip=2023-07-01-great-borne-starling-dodd).
- **Summit 50 Wainwrights in 2023:** I have summitted 51 Wainwrights this year. Summit 50 was Wandope on 11th November.

[This view of my photo gallery](../../gallery?tag=wainwright&year=2023&order=oldest) contains one photo of each Wainwright summit that I made this year.

## Photography

This year I pursued photography as a hobby as fully as I could. In June I bought a Sony ɑ7r V mirrorless camera as a significant upgrade to my iPhone 14 Pro Max. Since then, my lens collection has grown, and I've began to pursue astrophotography.

Some numbers:
- 29,000 photos taken:
  - *iPhone 14 Pro Max:* 15,000.
  - *Sony ɑ7r V:* 13,700.
  - *Sony ɑ550:* 230.
- 12,665 photos kept (44%).
- 1,163 photos [added to my gallery](../../gallery?year=2023&order=oldest).
- 122 photos [selected for my annual shortlist](../../gallery?tag=annual-shortlist&year=2023&order=oldest). This list is the best way to flick through the best of my year.

## Rankings

What's a retrospective without a list or two?
