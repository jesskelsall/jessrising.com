Across the inlet waters of Loch na Cuilce, a view of [Coruisk Memorial Hut](https://www.glasgowjmcs.org.uk/coruisk.php) perched before the bare stone of a hill. Beyond it, Loch Coruisk lies out of sight in the space between hills, the blue haze of the air signifying the valley's width. In the foreground, an inflatable boat of lifejacket-adorned people motors forward, returning to two mast sailing ship moored in the bay.

There are three ways to Loch Coruisk: a long hike from [Sligachan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligachan), over the [Black Cuillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuillin), or via a boat tour from Elgol. The latter affords views such as these - dramatic hills and gentle waters effortlessly traversed by the [Bella Jane](https://www.bellajane.co.uk/boattrips.asp) on a tour to Loch Coruisk. Approaching the metal staircase landing seen centre right, this view unfolds before you. Other tourists can be seen waiting on the rocks above the landing, ready to depart back to Elgol once this group has disembarked.

Despite the Autumn day's forecast of rain, a warm clear skied morning helped to illuminate these views and effortlessly brought out the colour of both the green hillsides between the rocks, and the turquoise waters between the gentle ripples.
