The River Wear, brown and fast-moving from recent heavy rain, flows between the winter riverside trees. They are mostly devoid of leaves, creating a gnarled brown backdrop. To the right a modern blue road bridge is obscured by nearby branches.

The first photo of 2023 to bear a name, this shot captures the dreary brown and grey nature of mid-winter in England. Save for the blue tones of the cloudy sky, this landscape is waiting patiently for spring to arrive.
