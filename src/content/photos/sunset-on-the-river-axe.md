The mouth of the River Axe in [Seaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaton,_Devon) near Exeter. A variety of small fishing boats sit motionless upon the glassy river surface that reflects pink and orange tones from the setting sun.

In June 2022 I travelled to the south coast of England for a round tour of travel and meetings with friends. On this, the first day, I met my friend Chloe, who I first met online and have only met in person on two prior occasions. On my last visit we'd walked the riverside including over the bridge that this photo was taken on, so we ventured back shortly before parting ways.

Seaton is a typical English seaside town - a once vibrant beachfront now lies tired and mostly empty, frequented by local doc walkers and runners rather than tourists venturing to the beach for their summer holidays. The stony beach provides picturesque views along the Jurassic Coast and its dramatic cliffs, but beauty can also be found in unlikely avenues such as this one.

A glassy water's surface is a treat under any circumstances, but it is doubly beautiful reflecting the sunset colours, which dominate the colour-scape of this photo.
