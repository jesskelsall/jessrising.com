Large rocks on the shores of Wast Water and a prominent island give way to the length of the lake. Beyond it, some of the Lake District's most recognisable fells (left to right): Yewbarrow, Kirk Fell, Great Gable, Lingmell, and Illgill Head. Great Gable is barely visible due to the rain-filled air and thick clouds lingering on the peaks.

This angle is my go-to for Wast Water, my favourite lake of the Lake District. Today, a hike abandoned due to rain and visibility provided an opportunity to capture rainy scenes - typical at all times of year in the Lake District. The misty depths on show here paint a picture of this lake's geometry and surroundings.
