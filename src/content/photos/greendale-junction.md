A countryside signpost sits slightly crooked next to a road junction, identifying the valley as Greendale. To its right, Wasdale Head lies three miles away, the end of the road. Behind it, [Buckbarrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckbarrow)'s craggy outline.

These black and white signs topped with rings are found all over the Lake District and beyond. Harking back to a time before satellite navigation, they are beautiful where pure function would have sufficed.

Notice the small text written down the pole: [Cumberland County Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_County_Council,_England), a component of the newer [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria). This shows the sign has been here since at least 1974.
