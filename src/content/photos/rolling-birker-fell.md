Winter orange dormant ferns and yellowing slopes give way to an undulating descent down Stackers Brow. From the heights of Birker Fell, the distant hills appear like waves, one after another fading into the drizzly mist of the day. All throughout, a grey strip of road clings to this unlikely trail between Eskdale Green and Ulpha.
