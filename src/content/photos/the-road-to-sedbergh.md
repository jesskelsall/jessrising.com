A rough road stretches into the distance before turning sharply out of sight. It lines the undulating hills with little confidence. Beyond it, hills build into snow-capped Howgill Fells, stretching the entire length of the horizon.

Almost back to Kirkby Stephen on my typical route back from the Lake District, I took a chance on an uncharted junction, initially to return to [another vista I'd just driven past](./ravenstonedale-common). Curious what views it might lead me to, I pressed on. After rounding a corner and crossing a cattle grid, I was rewarded handsomely. The Howgill Fells were unseasonably snowy, begging for me to line up a shot from the centre of the silent road.
