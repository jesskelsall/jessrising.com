A dramatic orange sunset illuminates the clouds blood orange above hills and water. From Sandaig, the Isle of Skye can be seen across the Sound of Sleat. Beinn na Seamraig and Ben Aslak scrape against the clouds in the middle of the photo, while the unmistakably jagged peaks of the [Cuillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuillin) can be seen on the furthest horizon where muted blue haze meets orange. The waters are illuminated orange tones.

This photo was taken at the end of a particularly adventurous day with my friend Rin that saw us travel 8 hours by car to the very edge of the Isle of Skye. After failing to reach a vantage point over the Sandaig Islands due to an overgrown trail, we opted to drive further along the road. This led us higher up the hillside, revealing this view across to tomorrow's destination. There was no choice but to get out of the car and drink in the vista in silence together.
