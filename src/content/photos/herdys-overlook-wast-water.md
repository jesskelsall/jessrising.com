Two sheep (or herdys as they are known in the Lake District) overlook Wast Water from the edge of a grassy hill. Wast Water in the western Lake District is a stretch of water dramatically flanked by the Wasdale Screes, a long hill culminating in [Illgill Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illgill_Head), with steep cliffs and scree visible from top to bottom. The road from Nether Wasdale to Wasdale Head is visible in the corner, twisting across the yellowed April lakeside.

Wast Water is my favourite lake in the Lake District. After first visiting in 2018 when my girlfriend Sophie lived nearby in Ulverston, this often-overlooked corner of the region has kept its title. Only one road in, used mostly to access the hike up to [Scafell Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scafell_Pike), means the valley is typically quiet until the summer.

This visit was made with my friend Rin on our way to see Burnmoor Tarn. The vantage point provided by Water Crag (from where this photo was taken) gives panoramic views of Wast Water itself. The sheep patiently awaited our arrival before seemingly staring off over the lake once we reached the summit. They help to lead the eyes from the foreground to background, lending a sense of scale.
