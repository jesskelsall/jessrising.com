Three jagged pillars of rock protrude from the green ground at the base of the [Trotternish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotternish) landslip. Further down the hill, the land gives way to a procession of alternating water and hilly land: Loch Leathan, the western edge of Trotternish, the Sound of Raasay, the Isle of Rasaay, the Inner Sound, then finally the Scottish mainland. On the horizon, the [Cuillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuillin) mountain ranges, most notably the Black Cuillin directly behind the jagged pillars - known as the Old Man of Storr. The sky and distant air is vivid blue.

If Scotland could be represented in a single photo, this would be it. Climbing from the car park a short drive north of Portree, a short hike leads under or through the Old Man. The best view can be found from the dome-shaped hill behind it; from here the view is its most dramatic, a balance of the pillars below and the incredible rolling land beyond.

Landscape photography taken on perfectly clear days can be uninspiring for their lack of interest above the horizon, but I feel this one is an easy exception - a lack of haze on the horizon lays bare the stunning geography of Skye.
