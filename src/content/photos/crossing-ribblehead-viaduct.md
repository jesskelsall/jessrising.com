A [Northern Trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Trains) British Rail Class 158 *Express Sprinter* crosses Ribblehead Viaduct heading north. In the background, snow-covered Whernside can be seen through light cumulus clouds.

While I hadn't intended to capture a small commuter train crossing this famous viaduct while in the area, when you hear one coming, you make the most of the situation. Not far from my car, I dropped my gear and waited for just the right time.

This photo is a nice balance of its elements - the towering bridge, the crest of the fell, and the train sitting effortlessly between.
