A white sand beach punctuated by rock formations in orange and copper-green hues. By the water line more rocks breach the water's surface, and a larger mass of jagged land can be seen behind that. Dramatic clouds in mixed grey and white cast shadows on the distant Scottish mainland. On the horizon, the island of [Staffa](https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/staffa) can be seen, thin and dark.

Tràigh an t-Suidhe or *Beach of the Seat* is a peaceful set of sand on the northern edge of the isle of Iona, off the coast of the much large Isle of Mull. Getting here requires two boat journeys from mainland Scotland. Walking here from the boat landing along a quiet country road hammers home how remote and lonely this place is. The scenery across uninviting cold waters is as beautiful as a Scottish beach can get in late autumn.

The unique rock colours coupled with the abundance of grey-blue tones couples with the unique rock formations to create a busy photo where all its elements come together in foreboding harmony.
