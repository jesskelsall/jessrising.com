A dramatic slope of scree, descending mercilessly into Wast Water, stretches off into the mists beyond. High on its slopes, snow clings to its darker recesses, while clouds cling to its flat summit.

Illgill Head is intrinsically linked to Wast Water. Views of its slopes greet you as you first arrive at the lake's shores, but from this angle coming from Wasdale Head, the slopes can be appreciated fully.
