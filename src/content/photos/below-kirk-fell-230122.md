Kirk Fell's snow-kissed summit is obscured by clouds. Before it, Wasdale Head's flat moorland and trees on a hazy drizzly day.

Wasdale Head represents the end of the road - there is only one way in or out of the valley by car. Here, one of the Lake District's giants, in the shadow of Scafell Pike, looms.
