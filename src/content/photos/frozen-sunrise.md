An adolescent tree at head-height, its branches thick with delicate ice crystals, stands in a field of snow. Across the rolling fields the morning sun appears over the horizon, illuminating the snow and ice crystals.

This fateful winter morning ushered in my most prolific year of photography in my youth - 2010. It was a joy to tread over familiar fields near my childhood home, now covered with rare heavy snowfall. The morning's light brought twinkling wonderment to every shot I took, particularly this one.

A portrait variation of this photo taken moments before has spent over two years as my phone wallpaper.
