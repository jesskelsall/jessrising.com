The nave of Durham Cathedral, facing the choir. A group of students walks between empty pews, on their way to listen to an organ recital. The cathedral's interior is lit by spotlights near the ceiling, washing the bare stonework with moody lighting. At the far end, the Rose Window is lit from the inside rather than by sunlight from outside.

An evening organ recital provided an opportunity to briefly roam my home city's cathedral in the dark, a new experience for me. The emptiness and unique lighting provided a new perspective on a familiar place. I wonder what it must be like in here after the evening's event.
