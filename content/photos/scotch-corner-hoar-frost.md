Frozen trees, including evergreen pines, occupy the foreground, thick with frost. In the background, a curving road disappears between whitened trees above a blank light grey sky.

Heading back from the Lake District on the A66 towards Scotch Corner, suddenly midday frost and fog occupied the roads and surrounding scenery. Beyond Scotch Corner, where the A66 meets the A1(M), I left the familiar motorway in search of vantages over the odd phenomenon. Here, walking back from a farmer's access bridge over the motorway, the perfect angle revealed itself.
