A steam train called [The Jacobite](https://westcoastrailways.co.uk/jacobite/steam-train-trip) pulling carriages crosses the Glenfinnan Viaduct, a crescent shaped stone viaduct set amongst the dramatic hills surrounding the village of Glenfinnan. The steam train is approaching the camera, about to exit the viaduct, while its plume of white steam trails behind it, rising high into the air.

The Glenfinnan Viaduct is an icon of British architecture, made even more famous by frequent steam train service across it, which run between Fort William and coastal Mallaig. With adequate preparation it is possible to be lying in wait on this hillside overlooking the viaduct when the train arrives. On a muggy midge-infested day in June, my girlfriend and I made the pilgrimage, stood amongst one hundred others of equal conviction.

The extra pressure of subjects in motion makes this photo particularly impressive - the train and its steam is perfectly positioned in the frame.
