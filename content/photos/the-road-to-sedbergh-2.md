A rough road stretches into the distance before turning sharply out of sight. It lines the undulating hills with little confidence. Beyond it, green and brown-orange hills rise into the low drifting clouds, obscuring the summits. Above, thick grey cloud lingers.

One week after taking [The Road to Sedbergh](./the-road-to-sedbergh.md), I returned to the same spot while in search of future Settle-Carlisle line vantages. With no lingering snow, the low hanging clouds provided a different sort of scenery that had its own charm.
