Three sets of train lines stretch into the distance, curving left out of sight. Here lies Blea Moor signal box, a small raised building by the side of the track. To its left, a rectangular disheveled house. Around the tracks are snow-kissed moors. In the distance, a snow-covered valley gives way to snowy Ingleborough, its peak shrouded in a thin layer of cloud. The sky is blue save for puffs of cumulus clouds.

On a winter's day this view is perfect for [trainspotting](../../blog/p/2023-01-22-adventure-week-3). Low light and a stunning Yorkshire Dales backdrop is a winning combination. The footbridge is covered in grass and accessed by a wooden hop-over stile, though its other side leads nowhere.
