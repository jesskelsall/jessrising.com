A small white house and its shed is seen behind a rocky stream. Behind it, [Buachaille Etive MÃ²r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buachaille_Etive_M%C3%B2r) looms large, sprinkled with snow following a week of moderate snowfall over the Scottish Highlands.

There are many dramatic angles of the informally named Lagangarbh Hut, famed for its setting amongst the moors in upper Glen Coe. This view from the wooden bridge over the river Coupall shows the mountain and stream in all its glory, both shining under a changeably cloudy sky, illuminated by the perpetual [golden hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)) of this time of year in these latitudes.
