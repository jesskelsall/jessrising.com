The remaining columns and arches of [Fountains Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/yorkshire/fountains-abbey-and-studley-royal-water-garden), a Cistercian abbey left to ruin since 1539. Looking up between the columns towards where the main tower once stood, the stonework gives way to a perfectly blue summer sky, contrasting sharply with the texture of the structure.
