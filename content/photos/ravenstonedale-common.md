Farmer's fields delineated by rough stone walls and posts trail off down the hill. Beyond them, trees and further fields at the base of the Howgill Fells. Snow hangs onto grassy areas and the peaks, particularly of [Wild Boar Fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Boar_Fell) to the left.

This particular viewpoint is often passed but not easy to come by. From the top of the A685 exiting Kirkby Stephen, the road rises over Ash Fell before plunging over Ash Fell Edge, a sudden shock to unprepared drivers, especially in icy conditions. Here at the crest, a small muddy access trail allows a cheeky roadside stop and a perpendicular view over the edge of the Yorkshire Dales.
